# Model scope (MVP)

Minimum viable replication
- Domestic block + fiscal block + foreign SVAR block as in the working paper.
- Estimated parameters from the paper with identical priors.
- Observables list and measurement equations matching the paper.

Out of scope for MVP
- CGE-EUROMOD linkage.
- Skills segmentation and wage bargaining extensions.
- Shadow economy measurement equation (to be added later).

Disclosure
- Model outputs are conditional on paper parameterization and data vintage.
- Any deviations are documented in `docs/audit_checklist.md`.
