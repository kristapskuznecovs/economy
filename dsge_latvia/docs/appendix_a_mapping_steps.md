# Appendix A mapping steps (in progress)

Step 1: Transcribe equations
- Completed: Eq. (52)–(85) added to `dsge_latvia/model/spec.yaml`.

Step 2: Establish variable mapping
- Created `dsge_latvia/docs/variable_map.yaml` with verified vs. needs_review flags.
- Next: confirm meanings of tau_t_d, omega_t, R_t_f, r_t_k from Section 2.1 text.

Step 3: Normalize variable naming
- Align Appendix A variables with core block naming used in the rest of the model.
- This will happen after Step 2 is verified.
