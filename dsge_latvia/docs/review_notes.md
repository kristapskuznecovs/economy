# Review notes (user feedback)

Scope
- This note records review feedback and the resulting action items for the Latvia Fiscal DSGE rebuild.

Key strengths to preserve
- Detailed fiscal block with productive public investment and import content.
- Asymmetric transfers (optimizing vs restricted households).
- Foreign-held public debt channel.
- Multiple tax instruments with fiscal rules.

Technical points to verify
- Pro-cyclical wage mechanism (outside option specification) in the labour market block.
- Public vs private capital aggregation (CES and elasticity nu_k).
- Government risk premium equation (Eq. 22) and calibration of phi_tilde_g_r.
- Fiscal multiplier definition (present-value discounting and sign conventions).

Identification and estimation concerns
- Weak identification of fiscal rule output-gap reactions.
- Calibrated fiscal parameters vs estimated alternatives (import shares, transfer split).
- Sample stability across 1995–2018 (EU accession, euro adoption).

Robustness tasks
- Sensitivity to transfer distribution parameter tau_r_tr.
- Compare alternative public capital specifications if available (Appendix E).
- Prior-posterior plots for weakly identified parameters.
- Subsample estimation or time-varying parameter checks.
- Out-of-sample forecast evaluation.

Status
- Fiscal block equations and Tables 1–2 are transcribed from the 2023 PDF.
- Non-fiscal and foreign blocks await supplementary material (Appendices B/C/D).
